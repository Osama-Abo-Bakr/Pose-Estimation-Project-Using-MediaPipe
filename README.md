# Pose Estimation Using MediaPipe

## Overview
The **Pose Estimation** project leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV to perform real-time human pose detection using a webcam. The project detects and visualizes key body landmarks, providing valuable insights into human movements and poses. This foundation can be extended to numerous applications, including fitness tracking, healthcare monitoring, and interactive gaming.

## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Detection:** Processes live video feed to estimate and visualize human body landmarks.
- **Dual Output:** Displays both the original frame and a processed frame highlighting the detected pose.
- **Customizable Visualization:** Easily adjust the landmark visualization with different colors and line thicknesses.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## How It Works
### Pose Detection
The project uses MediaPipe's Pose solution to detect and track body landmarks from the webcam feed. The detected landmarks are then drawn on the video frames for visualization.

### Dual Visualization
The code creates two display windows:
1. **Original Frame:** Shows the webcam feed with pose landmarks drawn on top.
2. **Processed Frame:** Shows a blank window where only the pose landmarks are displayed.

### Code Explanation
1. **Setup MediaPipe and OpenCV:**
   Initialize the MediaPipe Pose model and OpenCV for video capture.
   ```python
   mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
   mp_draw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
   pose = mp_pose.Pose()
   ```

2. **Process Video Frames:**
   Capture frames from the webcam and process them with the Pose model.
   ```python
   result = pose.process(frame)
   ```

3. **Draw Landmarks:**
   Draw the detected landmarks on both the original and a blank frame for dual visualization.
   ```python
   mp_draw.draw_landmarks(frame, result.pose_landmarks, mp_pose.POSE_CONNECTIONS, ...)
   mp_draw.draw_landmarks(new_wind, result.pose_landmarks, mp_pose.POSE_CONNECTIONS, ...)
   ```

4. **Display Output:**
   Show the original frame with landmarks and the processed blank frame with only the pose landmarks.
   ```python
   cv2.imshow("image", frame)
   cv2.imshow("new_window", new_wind)
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Pose Analysis:** Incorporate additional logic to analyze poses and provide feedback, e.g., for fitness or physical therapy.
- **Application Integration:** Integrate pose estimation with other systems like augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) applications.
- **Multi-Person Detection:** Extend the project to handle multiple people in the frame simultaneously.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of computer vision in interpreting and understanding human movements. It's an exciting starting point for applications that require real-time pose analysis, and Iâ€™m looking forward to expanding its capabilities.
